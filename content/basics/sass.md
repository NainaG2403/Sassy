<u>Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style-Sheets)</u> <br/>
> Sass is an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.<br/>
> It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.<br/>
> Sass initially described a syntax of which the defining characteristic was its indentation-sensitivity. <br/>
> Soon enough, Sass maintainers decided to close the gap between Sass and CSS by providing a CSS-friendly syntax called SCSS for Sassy CSS.
