<strong><u> Why Sass over CSS</u></strong>

SCSS and SASS are the advance version of CSS3 (CSS),
These are their extension which allow you to write clean and quickly they are help tools for CSS language itself.
With these preprocessors you can write more reusable code.

The point is not to turn CSS into a fully featured programming language; Sass only wants to help where CSS fails
So it simply adds a couple of extra features on top of it.
It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, inline imports, and more, all with a fully CSS-compatible syntax.

We will have a look at these features in the upcoming sections.
