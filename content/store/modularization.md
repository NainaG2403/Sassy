A module is a unit of code contained in a Sass partial. This directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. 
Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables. Some of the benefits of modularity — code that’s easy to read, update, and maintain.
It makes it much easier to reuse styles across stylesheets for a given project or even to share code between projects. 

<u>Advantages of using modularization in Sass: </u>

1)Development Time:
By using the concept of modularization in Sass,we can reduce the development time as we can create partials which are reusable code snippets. This helps to  save effort and time.

2)Organised File Structure:
Sass partials can be compiled into one stylesheet, eliminating the need for all those extra HTTP requests. Also by using the @import directive, our CSS can be broken into multiple partials for organizational purposes. 

Modularization combined with Partials helps in organizing Sass files.
