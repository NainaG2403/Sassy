Placeholders

1.Unlike mixins, placeholders can be used multiple times without adding any duplicate code.This makes them a much friendlier option for outputting DRY CSS
2.Including a mixin is the same as copying and pasting the styles throughout the CSS file. It creates a mass of duplicate code and can bloat your CSS file.
3. The repeated code in the placeholder is output only once with only the unique styles being applied to the individual selectors. 
If unused, the placeholder styles are not output at all.
